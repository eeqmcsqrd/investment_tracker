# Investment Performance vs Banking Tracking

## Your Updated Configuration

For **true investment performance evaluation**, you're now tracking only these accounts:

```python
TRACKED_INVESTMENTS = [
    'RBC',           # Retirement account
    'Binance',       # Crypto exchange
    '401k',          # Retirement account
    'Ledger Wallet'  # Crypto wallet
]
```

## Why This Matters

### Investment Accounts vs Bank Balances

**Investment Accounts** (RBC, Binance, 401k, Ledger):
- ✅ Subject to market performance
- ✅ Can gain or lose value
- ✅ Used for wealth building
- ✅ Performance matters

**Bank Balances** (Revolut, WISE, HAPO, etc.):
- ❌ Not investments
- ❌ No market performance
- ❌ Just cash holding
- ❌ Performance = irrelevant

## How This Changes Your Analysis

### Old Way (All Accounts)

```
Start Value:  $191,485.90 (includes all cash)
End Value:    $195,609.70 (includes all cash)
Change:       $4,123.80

Problem: Includes bank balance changes that aren't "performance"
```

### New Way (Investments Only)

```
Start Value:  $XXX,XXX (only RBC + Binance + 401k + Ledger)
End Value:    $YYY,YYY (only RBC + Binance + 401k + Ledger)
Change:       $ZZZ (true investment performance)

Benefit: Pure investment performance tracking
```

---

## Concrete Example: Why This Matters

### Scenario: You Move Money Around

**Month 1:**
```
401k: $50,000
Binance: $10,000
Revolut: $5,000
Total: $65,000
```

**Month 2: You transfer $2,000 from Revolut to Binance**
```
401k: $50,000 (no change)
Binance: $12,000 (+$2,000 from transfer)
Revolut: $3,000 (-$2,000 transferred out)
Total: $65,000 (no real change)
```

### If Tracking ALL Accounts:
```
Binance increase: +$2,000 → Looks like "income"
Revolut decrease: -$2,000 → Looks like "expense"
Net: $0 ✅ (correct but confusing)
```

### If Tracking ONLY Investments:
```
Binance increase: +$2,000 → Deposit (not performance)
401k: No change
True performance: $0 ✅ (clear and accurate)
```

---

## Real Investment Performance Example

### Scenario: Pure Market Gains

**Month 1:**
```
RBC: $100,000
Binance: $20,000
401k: $50,000
Ledger: $10,000
Total Investments: $180,000
```

**Month 2: Market gains, no deposits/withdrawals**
```
RBC: $102,000 (+2%)
Binance: $22,000 (+10%)
401k: $51,000 (+2%)
Ledger: $11,000 (+10%)
Total Investments: $186,000
```

**True Investment Performance:**
```
Start: $180,000
End: $186,000
Gain: $6,000 (+3.33%)

This is PURE market performance ✅
```

---

## How The App Will Use This

### Portfolio Performance Section

With `TRACKED_INVESTMENTS` set to your 4 accounts:

**Will Show:**
```
Investment Performance (RBC, Binance, 401k, Ledger only)
Start Value: $XXX,XXX
End Value: $YYY,YYY
Change: $ZZZ
Return: X.XX%
```

**Will NOT Include:**
- Bank balance changes
- Cash account fluctuations
- Currency exchange gains/losses
- Money sitting in Revolut/WISE/etc.

### Sustainability Section

This still tracks ALL accounts because:
- Income = All increases (including bank deposits)
- Expenses = Revolut spending
- Net = Overall cash flow

**This section measures cash flow, not investment performance.**

---

## Your Investment Portfolio Breakdown

### Current Allocation (Example)

Let's say your tracked investments are:

```
RBC (Retirement):     $XX,XXX (XX%)
401k (Retirement):    $XX,XXX (XX%)
Binance (Crypto):     $XX,XXX (XX%)
Ledger Wallet (Crypto): $XX,XXX (XX%)
─────────────────────────────────
Total Investments:    $XXX,XXX (100%)
```

**This is your TRUE investment portfolio.**

### Excluded from Performance Tracking

```
Revolut - EUR:        $X,XXX (spending money)
WISE - USD:           $X,XXX (transfer account)
RBC Bank Canada:      $X,XXX (banking)
HAPO Checking:        $X,XXX (banking)
HAPO Savings:         $X,XXX (emergency fund)
─────────────────────────────────
Total Cash/Banking:   $XX,XXX

Purpose: Liquidity, spending, emergencies
Not tracked for investment performance
```

---

## Understanding Returns

### With Only Investments Tracked

**Example Calculation:**
```
Starting Investment Value: $150,000
Ending Investment Value: $156,000
Time Period: 6 months

Absolute Return: $6,000
Percentage Return: 4%
Annualized Return: ~8%
```

**This tells you:**
- ✅ How well your investments performed
- ✅ Whether you're beating inflation
- ✅ If your asset allocation is working
- ✅ Your true investment growth rate

### If You Included Bank Accounts

**Problem:**
```
You deposit $10,000 in Revolut for a trip
  → Looks like +$10,000 "gain"
You spend $8,000 from Revolut on the trip
  → Looks like -$8,000 "loss"
Net: +$2,000 but it's not investment performance!
```

**This would skew all your performance metrics.**

---

## Comparing Your Investments

With the 4 tracked accounts, you can now compare:

### By Asset Class

**Traditional Retirement (RBC + 401k):**
```
Combined: $XX,XXX
Return: X.XX%
```

**Cryptocurrency (Binance + Ledger):**
```
Combined: $XX,XXX
Return: X.XX%
```

**Which performed better?**
- Compare returns
- Adjust allocation if needed
- Rebalance portfolio

### By Account

**Individual Performance:**
```
RBC:           X.XX% return
401k:          X.XX% return
Binance:       X.XX% return
Ledger Wallet: X.XX% return
```

**Questions to ask:**
- Which is outperforming?
- Should you increase allocation to winners?
- Are fees affecting returns?
- Is diversification working?

## How To View Your Pure Investment Performance

### In Your App

1. **Dashboard Tab**
   - Look at metrics
   - These now reflect only your 4 investment accounts
   - Ignore sustainability section for investment performance

2. **Performance Tab**
   - "Portfolio Performance Over Time"
   - This chart now shows only investment accounts
   - Pure market performance tracking

3. **Advanced Analytics Tab**
   - Risk metrics (only investments)
   - Correlation analysis (only investments)
   - Sharpe ratio (only investments)

### Filter Options

In any chart, you can:
- Select "All" → Shows your 4 investments
- Select specific ones → Compare individual accounts
- Date range → See performance over time

---

## What About Deposits to Investments?

### The Deposit Problem

When you deposit to an investment account:
```
Day 1: 401k = $50,000
Day 2: You deposit $1,000
Day 2: 401k = $51,000

Question: Is this $1,000 a "gain"?
Answer: No, it's a deposit
```

**The system still can't distinguish this automatically.**

But now you can mentally separate:
- "I deposited to my 4 investment accounts"
- "My investment accounts grew in value"

### Manual Tracking Recommended

For accurate performance:
```
Keep a separate log:
- Jan 1: Deposited $1,000 to 401k
- Feb 1: Deposited $1,000 to 401k
- Mar 1: Deposited $500 to Binance

Total deposits: $2,500
```

Then calculate:
```
Investment Growth = End Value - Start Value - Deposits + Withdrawals
```

## Updated Configuration Summary

### What Changed

**Before:**
```python
TRACKED_INVESTMENTS = [
    'Binance', 'Trade Republic', '401k', 'RBC',
    'Sui Wallet', 'Phantom Wallet', 'Ledger Wallet'
]
```
7 accounts tracked (mixed investments and wallets)

**After:**
```python
TRACKED_INVESTMENTS = [
    'RBC',           # Retirement
    'Binance',       # Crypto
    '401k',          # Retirement
    'Ledger Wallet'  # Crypto
]
```
4 accounts tracked (pure investments only)

### Why This Is Better

✅ **Clearer focus**: Only true investment accounts
