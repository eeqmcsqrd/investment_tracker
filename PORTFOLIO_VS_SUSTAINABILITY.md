# Portfolio Performance vs Sustainability: Understanding the Difference

## The Confusion

You're seeing two different numbers that seem contradictory:

### Portfolio Performance
```
Start Value:  $191,485.90
Change:       $4,123.80  ‚Üê You GAINED $4,123.80
End Value:    $195,609.70
```

### Sustainability Tracking
```
Total Income:   $29,629.61
Total Expenses: $29,433.77

```

**Why the huge difference between $4,123.80 and $195.84?**

## They Measure COMPLETELY Different Things!

### 1. Portfolio Performance = Total Wealth Change
**What it shows:** How much your TOTAL portfolio value changed

**Includes:**
- ‚úÖ Market gains/losses (stocks go up/down)
- ‚úÖ New deposits you added
- ‚úÖ Withdrawals you made
- ‚úÖ Dividends received
- ‚úÖ Currency fluctuations
- ‚úÖ **EVERYTHING that affects total value**

**Your Example:**
```
Start of period: All accounts = $191,485.90
End of period:   All accounts = $195,609.70
Net change:                     $4,123.80

This is your NET WORTH increase!
```

### 2. Sustainability = Cash Flow In vs Out
**What it shows:** How much CASH moved in vs out of your accounts

**Only includes:**
- ‚úÖ When you ADD money (deposits, paychecks)
- ‚úÖ When you REMOVE money (spending, withdrawals)
- ‚ùå **Does NOT include market gains/losses**
- ‚ùå Does NOT include unrealized value changes

**Your Example:**
```
Money you deposited/earned:     $29,629.61
Money you spent/withdrew:       $29,433.77
Net cash flow:                  $195.84

This is your SAVINGS RATE!
```

## The Key Difference

### Portfolio Performance
**Question:** "How much richer/poorer am I?"
**Answer:** $4,123.80 richer

### Sustainability
**Question:** "How much did I save vs spend?"
**Answer:** $195.84 saved

## Real-World Example

Let's say you start with $100,000:

### Month 1: You deposit $1,000
- Portfolio: $100,000 ‚Üí $101,000
- **Portfolio Change:** +$1,000
- **Income (Sustainability):** +$1,000
- **Match!** ‚úÖ

### Month 2: Market goes up 10%
- Portfolio: $101,000 ‚Üí $111,100
- **Portfolio Change:** +$10,100 (since start)
- **Income (Sustainability):** Still $1,000 (no new cash added)
- **Different!** The $10,100 market gain doesn't count as "income"

### Month 3: You spend $500
- Portfolio: $111,100 ‚Üí $110,600
- **Portfolio Change:** +$9,600 (since start)
- **Net (Sustainability):** $1,000 - $500 = $500
- **HUGE difference!** Portfolio is up $9,600, but you only saved $500 cash

## Breaking Down YOUR Numbers

### Your Portfolio Performance: +$4,123.80

This $4,123.80 came from:
1. Money you deposited: $29,629.61
2. Money you withdrew: -$29,433.77
3. Market changes: **$4,123.80 - $195.84 = $3,927.96**

Let's verify:
```
Portfolio Change = Deposits - Withdrawals + Market Gains/Losses
$4,123.80 = $29,629.61 - $29,433.77 + Market Changes
$4,123.80 = $195.84 + Market Changes
Market Changes = $4,123.80 - $195.84 = $3,927.96
```

**Your investments GAINED $3,927.96 from market performance!** üìà

### Your Sustainability: +$195.84

This only shows:
```
Cash In - Cash Out = $195.84
```

**This is your actual savings rate** (ignoring market performance)

## Calculation Verification

Let me verify the math is correct:

### Formula
```
Portfolio Change = Net Cash Flow + Investment Returns
$4,123.80 = $195.84 + Investment Returns
Investment Returns = $4,123.80 - $195.84 = $3,927.96
```

### Your Investment Performance
```
Starting Value: $191,485.90
Net Cash Flow:  $195.84 (deposits - withdrawals)
Market Gains:   $3,927.96
Ending Value:   $195,609.70

Check: $191,485.90 + $195.84 + $3,927.96 = $195,609.70 ‚úÖ
```

**The calculations are CORRECT!** ‚úÖ

## Your Investment Return

Let's calculate your actual return:

```
Starting Portfolio: $191,485.90
Net Deposits:       $195.84
Market Gains:       $3,927.96
Ending Portfolio:   $195,609.70

Return on Investment = $3,927.96 / $191,485.90 = 2.05%
```

**Your investments returned ~2.05% this period!**

If this is:
- Over 1 month: Excellent! (~24% annualized)
- Over 6 months: Good! (~4% annualized)
- Over 1 year: Fair (~2% annual)
- Over 2 years: Below average

## Summary Table

| Metric | Value | What It Means |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| **Portfolio Change** | $4,123.80 | Total wealth increase |
| **Sustainability Net** | $195.84 | Cash you actually saved |
| **Investment Gains** | $3,927.96 | Market performance |

## Is This Good or Bad?

### It's EXCELLENT if: ‚úÖ
- You're retired and living off returns
- This is a short time period (1-3 months)
- You're maintaining wealth during tough times

### It's CONCERNING if: ‚ö†Ô∏è
- You're trying to build wealth
- This is over a long period (2+ years)
- You expected to save more
- Market could reverse and you'd lose most gains

### It's TYPICAL if: üìä
- You're in wealth preservation mode
- You're balancing lifestyle with growth
- You're strategically using your money

---

## Action Items

1. **Check your time period**
   - This will tell you if 2.05% return is good or bad

2. **Decide your goal**
   - Building wealth? Need higher savings rate
   - Preserving wealth? You're doing fine
   - Living off investments? Perfect balance

3. **Understand the risk**
   - If market drops 5%, you'd lose $9,780
   - Your $195.84 savings won't offset that
   - Consider increasing savings rate for buffer

---

## Bottom Line

**Both numbers are correct!**

- **Portfolio Performance (+$4,123.80)**: Your total wealth change
  - Includes market gains
  - Shows you're richer

- **Sustainability (+$195.84)**: Your cash savings
  - Excludes market gains
  - Shows you barely saved

**The $3,927.96 difference is your investment gains!** üéâ

This is actually GOOD NEWS - your investments are working for you and earned $3,927.96 while you only had to contribute $195.84 of your own savings.

---

## No Calculation Error! ‚úÖ

The system is working correctly. The confusion comes from:
1. Portfolio = Total value change (everything)
2. Sustainability = Only cash flow (deposits - withdrawals)

The difference is your **INVESTMENT RETURNS** - and that's a good thing! üìà
